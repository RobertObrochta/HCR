# Handwriting Character Recognition
## Model Configuration

### To-Do
- [ ] Test on STM32MPU - real-time inferencing
- [x] Figure out original model from STMCubeMX-AI Analysis
- [x] Test to see if this model predicts with consistency
- [x] Visualization - accuracy confusion matrix (heatmap)
- [X] Visualization for MNIST dataset
